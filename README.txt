# MiniProject-UNR

The repository contains four files at the moment:

*Robot.h
*Robot.cpp
*random_walk.cpp
*random_walk_1.cpp

The project execute two nodes on the stageros simulator: RobotWander and RobotFollower. The RobotWander node is created in the random_walk.cpp file and the RobotFollower is created in the random_walk_1.cpp file. Then, it is necessary to create two robots in the .world file to execute them correctly.

The class Robot is declared and defined in the files: Robot.h and Robot.cpp respectively. It contains all the functions and attributes necessary to make a robot wander in a random place.

Currently, the RobotWander and RobotFollower nodes will wander in a world in stageros simulator. Although, I'm still working to make RobotFollower to make honor to its name and actually follow the RobotWander instead of just wander like the other robot.

Stay tuned!

Best,

Andres Torres Garcia
